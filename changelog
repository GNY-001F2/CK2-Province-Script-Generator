New in 2.1.1 released on 2016-07-15:

 - Fixed a major bug that caused usedrgbvalues.txt to grow exponentially with
   multiple uses due to an incorrectly set write mode
 - Added compactor.py to assist existing files to be shrunk down for
   significant file size decreases depending on the number of repeated lines
   in the list.

New in 2.1.0 released on 2016-05-26:

 - Added support for comments right after province name. Once the "//" starts
   everything after it will be skipped in that line.
    Example, the following in provinces.txt:

    ...
    // a bunch of provinces here
    ...
    York
    ...
    Rome // This should be de jure capital Italy
    ...
    // Swedish provinces
    ...
    Vestergautland
    ...

    would give the following in definitions.csv:

    ...
    26;242;56;20;York;x
    ...
    82;92;78;252;Rome;x
    ...
    129;83;128;99;Vestergautland;
    ...

    Note: "..." is skipped lines.
 - Added basic documentation for each function in the program.

New in v2.0 released on 2016-05-24:

 - Dropped support for delimiters to decrease my maintenance overhead.
   Consequently, the -d flag no longer works in this release.
   Every province should be listed in a separate line.
   If there are extra spaces between words they will be condensed to one space.
   Similarly, leading and trailing spaces in every line will be trimmed.
 - Added support for C-style single-line comments denoted with '//'. NOTE: Do not list
   province names in the same line as a comment, that is not supported.
 - The script now supports the presence of empty lines for improved formatting.
