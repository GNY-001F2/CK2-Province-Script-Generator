New in 2.1.0 released on 2016-05-26:

 - Added support for comments right after province name. Once the "//" starts
   everything after it will be skipped in that line.
    Example, the following in provinces.txt:

    ...
    // a bunch of provinces here
    ...
    York
    ...
    Rome // This should be de jure capital Italy
    ...
    // Swedish provinces
    ...
    Vestergautland
    ...

    would give the following in definitions.csv:

    ...
    26;242;56;20;York;x
    ...
    82;92;78;252;Rome;x
    ...
    129;83;128;99;Vestergautland;
    ...

    Note: "..." is skipped lines.
 - Added basic documentation for each function in the program.

New in v2.0 released on 2016-05-24:

 - Dropped support for delimiters to decrease my maintenance overhead.
   Consequently, the -d flag no longer works in this release.
   Every province should be listed in a separate line.
   If there are extra spaces between words they will be condensed to one space.
   Similarly, leading and trailing spaces in every line will be trimmed.
 - Added support for C-style single-line comments denoted with '//'. NOTE: Do not list
   province names in the same line as a comment, that is not supported.
 - The script now supports the presence of empty lines for improved formatting.
