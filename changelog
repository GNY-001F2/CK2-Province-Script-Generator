New in v2.0 released on 2016-05-24:

 - Dropped support for delimiters to decrease my maintenance overhead.
   Consequently, the -d flag no longer works in this release.
   Every province should be listed in a separate line.
   If there are extra spaces between words they will be condensed to one space.
   Similarly, leading and trailing spaces in every line will be trimmed.
 - Added support for C-style single-line comments denoted with '//'. NOTE: Do not list
   province names in the same line as a comment, that is not supported.
 - The script now supports the presence of empty lines for improved formatting.
