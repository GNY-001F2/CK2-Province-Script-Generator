contains basic mapping information for each 
\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n##Instructions\r\n\r\n* You need Python 3. This script was 
written and tested on Python 3.5.1 but\r\nslightly older versions should work as 
well.\r\n\r\n* DO NOT try to run this script on Python 2. Python 3 and Python 2 
are not\r\ncompatible with each other.\r\n\r\n* You can download the appropriate 
verison of Python 3 from\r\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/\r\n  * If you use 
an OS with a package manager (most mainstream *nixes) you can\r\ndownload 
python3 from there if you do not already have it.\r\n\r\n* This program is 
invoked from a command line interface. I have only tested it\r\non a linux 
terminal, but you should be able to run it on a Windows 
Powershell\r\n(preferred) or Command Prompt without problems, especially with 
the default.\r\n\r\n* This program will create a .csv (default - 
definitions.csv) to store\r\nmapping information and another file (default - 
usedrgbvalues.txt) to store used\r\nrgb values\r\n\r\n* You can supply a list of 
already used values as well, by telling the program\r\nthe name of that file. 
The file should be stored in the same directory as your\r\npath.\r\n\r\n* 
Depending on what your default python executable is, on most machines you 
will\r\neither execute the program as \r\n  * `python3 psg.py [options]` OR\r\n  
* `python psg.py [options]`\r\n  * Default options are supplied. Use `python 
psg.py -h` to learn what they are\r\nand how to customize their values.\r\n\r\nI 
hope you find this program useful!\r\n\r\nThis program is licensed under the 
GPLv2 only.\r\n",
